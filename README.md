# About
This repo is contains collection for internal concepts of Pytorch in short. Also some notes for CUDA programming as I learnt along the way. 

# Torch
>Pytorch is an open source is an open source machine learning framework that accerlates path from reserach prototyping to production deployment.

Pytorch has many Deep Learning primitives, Neural Networks, Activation and Loss Functions, optimizers and also associated libraries for Computer Vision and NLP together with the support of Hardware accerlertion through GPU(CUDA).

Since Pytorch is open source it is very developed and is used in many big companies such as Microsoft, FastAI, etc.

## Tensors 
Tensors are multidimesional array that support
very fast mathematical calculations and has over 300 operations.

It is access through python API and is compiled through C++ which is optimized through CPU and GPU.

## AutoGrad - PyTorch Automatic Diffrentiation Engine
